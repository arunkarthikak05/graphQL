GraphQL is a query language and runtime for APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) that was developed by Facebook.
It provides a more efficient, flexible, and powerful alternative to traditional REST APIs.

**Query Language:** GraphQL allows clients to request only the data they need, and in the format they need it. Clients define the structure of the response, reducing over-fetching or under-fetching of data.

**Hierarchical Structure:** GraphQL queries follow a hierarchical structure, mirroring the shape of the response data. This makes it easy to understand and organize queries.

**Single Endpoint:** Unlike REST, which often requires multiple endpoints for different resources, GraphQL typically has a single endpoint. Clients can request all the necessary data in a single query.

**How to use a GraphQL server:**
Creating a GraphQL server involves the following steps:

**Define a Schema:** Specify the types of data available and the relationships between them using the GraphQL Schema Definition Language (SDL).

**Set up Resolvers:** Resolvers are functions that define how to fetch the data for each field in the schema. They are responsible for returning the actual data.

**Create an Endpoint:** Set up a server (using a framework like Express, Django, etc.) that exposes a single endpoint for handling GraphQL queries.

**Handle Queries:** Parse incoming GraphQL queries and use the defined resolvers to fetch the requested data.

**Mutations and Subscriptions:** Implement mutations for updating data and subscriptions for real-time updates if needed.

Popular tools for implementing GraphQL servers include **Apollo Server**, Express GraphQL, and GraphQL Yoga.
